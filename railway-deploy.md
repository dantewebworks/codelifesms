# ðŸš€ Deploy Real Webhook to Railway

Railway is easier than Vercel for Node.js servers and will definitely work.

## Step 1: Prepare Files
1. Create folder: `webhook-real`
2. Copy these files:
   - `webhook-server.js` â†’ rename to `index.js`
   - `webhook-package-real.json` â†’ rename to `package.json`

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub (free)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo" OR "Empty Project"
5. If empty project: drag your `webhook-real` folder
6. Click "Deploy"

## Step 3: Get Your URL
After deployment, Railway will give you a URL like:
`https://webhook-real-production-abc123.up.railway.app`

## Step 4: Test Your Webhook
Visit your URL in browser, should see:
```json
{
  "status": "Webhook is running! ðŸš€",
  "endpoints": {...}
}
```

## Step 5: Use in Dashboard
Your webhook URL will be:
`https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/webhook`

Your messages API will be:
`https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/messages`

## Why Railway Works Better
- Supports Node.js servers natively
- Easier deployment process
- Better for real-time webhooks
- Free tier with good limits
- Automatic HTTPS

## Alternative: Render.com
If Railway doesn't work, try Render.com:
1. Go to render.com
2. Sign up free
3. Click "New Web Service"
4. Connect GitHub or upload files
5. Use same files

Both Railway and Render are better than Vercel for webhook servers.
